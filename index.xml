      <description>My client, Dare West, was engaged by Curzon to build a highly engaging listing site for their cinema and on-demand streaming services, and a CMS capable of wrangling huge amounts of data in a flexible and intuitive way. They were particularly concerned with delivering an intuitive system for their content editors to keep the website updated. I was brought on to the project with this in mind - to improve and extend the way the content was managed in the CMS.</description>

      <description>My client, Cogworks, was engaged by Abel &amp; Cole to build an eCommerce platform to bring their organic, sustainable food delivery service to life. Together, we built a fast, responsive Umbraco website, with eCommerce functionality provided by Merchello to handle their product catalog. The system allowed customers to set up regular and one-off orders of Abel &amp; Cole&#39;s delicious organic food range. We built a custom REST web API to sync product, order and delivery information between the website and the client&#39;s fulfillment systems.</description>
